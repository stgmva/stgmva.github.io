title: If You Want Data, Don't Cock It Up

> The Apple ID password linked to the iPhone belonging to one of the San Bernardino terrorists was changed less than 24 hours after the government took possession of the device, senior Apple executives said Friday. If that hadnâ€™t happened, Apple said, a backup of the information the government was seeking may have been accessible.

So it's law enforcement's own fault they can't access the data, and we should now trust them with the power of a backdoor to all iPhones?
