> The San Bernardino litigation isn't about trying to set a precedent or send any kind of message. It is about the victims and justice.  

[via [Lawfare](https://www.lawfareblog.com/we-could-not-look-survivors-eye-if-we-did-not-follow-lead)]

Look, we know, they know -- this is **all** about setting precedent. The proof is in the pudding:

> The U.S. Justice Department is looking at court orders forcing Apple Inc to help investigators extract data from iPhones in about a dozen undisclosed cases across the country, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing sources.

One phone...a dozen phones. Counting is hard.
