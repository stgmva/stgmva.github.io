## How to get started?

1. [Download *Simplicity*](https://github.com/Phlow/simplicity/archive/gh-pages.zip)
2. Unzip the archive.
3. Open the *Simplicity*-folder in your Terminal.
4. Type `bundle install`
5. Type `bundle exec jekyll serve --config _config.yml,_config_dev.yml`
6. Visit *<http://localhost:4000/>* in your browser.
7. Start customizing *Simplicity* to your liking :)

*What does this do?* [Bundler](http://bundler.io/) is a tool to help you install all the needed Gems (programs, modules) needed to use Simplicity. The second command starts Jekyll with bundler and overwrites with the second configuration file *_config_dev.yml* some settings in *_config.yml* like the URL with the development URL *http://localhost:4000/*.
