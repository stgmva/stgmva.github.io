## Introduction

There are lots of great themes for Jekyll to start a new blog, portfolio or website. Either these themes are bloated because they use Bootstrap, Foundation, jQuery or they are so minimal, that it doesn't make fun to use them.

## Speed

*Simplicity* goes a different path: Webpages built with *Simplicity* are **superfast** without unnecessary clutter unless you need it. Your readers will love your site because HTML- and CSS-files are minified and only a few requests are needed to load the site. If you don't go crazy on images, it will be the fastest website possible.



## Customization

When I built my first official theme called [*Feeling Responsive*][1] I wanted to built a flexible site built on-top of Foundation. The main goal was to deliver a theme to produce high quality site. I use it for my clients and it works fine. *Simplicity* benefits from this. **But** I wanted and needed a blog which is even fast without unnecessary clutter and foremost *no Javascript*.



## What I like best about *Simplicity*

I adore minimalism. I love blogs with reduced interfaces which concentrate on content, speed and typography. Even when I visit these blogs with a bad mobile connection, they deliver content and user experience fast. **And** I figured out a way to reduce the amount of work to be done, when you start blogging. That's why *Simplicity* was born. To start a post, you just have to add one line of front matter:

~~~
---
title: New Posting
---
~~~

Then start writing.


## Beef it up!

Minimalism and simplicity don't stand for an option-less theme. On the contrary! You can style your content quickly in many ways. *Simplicity* allows you to use additional front matter variables, but you don't need them. You want to post a video? Just add…

…and the theme uses the variable to add the video on top of your headline. You like subheadines, like I do? Add…

    subheadline: Webdesign

…and Simplicity adds it.

You want an image on top of your article? Just add…

    image: death-to-the-stock-photography-3457.jpg

And refine it with a caption and/or link if needed:
