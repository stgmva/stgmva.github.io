title: Zeobit exposes 13 million users' data

> Anti-virus company MacKeeper is making headlines today for its lax security on a customer database that contained 13 million customer records complete with names, email addresses, usernames, password hashes, phone numbers, IP address, and system information.

Big surprise, Zeobit, a company well know to Mac users for their obtrusive adds promising to 'clean up your Mac', yet failing in every regard to do anything of the sort has (borrowing [Steve Gibson's](https://youtube.com/watch?v=PfCuL8I7onU) words) **done it wrong.**

Even less surprising still, they were hashing users passwords with MD5. MD5 in this day and age? Come on, they might as well have put them in a .txt file called "User passwords, please don't steal."

Not sure if I should feel angry at Zeobit, or angry at the customers silly enough to have bought their software.
