I don't care for most artisan keycaps, but a keycap of Vader's mask as seen in _The Force Awakens_ was a must have.

A group buy for this keycap came and went on [Massdrop](https://www.massdrop.com/buy/darth-vader-artisan-keycap/?mode=guest_open) this morning. I was lucky enough to have snatched one up before they were all gone.

It won't arrive until February, but it should go nicely with my [Originative Carbon Black](https://www.massdrop.com/buy/originative-carbon-black-keycaps/?mode=guest_open) keycaps.
