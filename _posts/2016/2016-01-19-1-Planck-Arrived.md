Nearly 6 months after the group buy on [Massdrop](https://www.massdrop.com/buy/planck-mechanical-keyboard) ended, my Planck has finally arrived!

Anodized purple plate, Planck PCB, Universal Plate.

The case looks especially gorgeous, ordering purple was _definitely_ the right call.

Compared to even a 60% board, this think is tiny! I'm so excited to get it built.
