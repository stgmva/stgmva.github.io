Due to a pretty gnarly blizzard in my area today, the office was closed. Mind you, I wasn't clever enough to check my work email _before_ I drove to the office, so I rolled up at 9AM to find no cars there. Back to the apartment I went.

Sadly, there is no rest for the wicked...err...those with laptops I mean - so I'll spend the day manning the Help Desk phone from work. Typically each tech only works the phone 2 hours a day, but we're expected to man it for the whole 8 hours when working from home.

So until 5:30 this work-from-hoth Battle Station will be fully operational.
