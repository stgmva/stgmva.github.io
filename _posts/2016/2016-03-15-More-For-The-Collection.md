Last week I got in some new parts for a future build, a lovely Zorbcaps artisan keycap, and a really unique new-in-box vintage board.

First: a blue Tex aluminum 60% case. This is just like the case I've got on my white alps board. This one will be used for the blue alps build.

The case is anodized aluminum. It has a beautiful blue color, and it just looks stellar under the lights.

Pictured below is the [HHKB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Happy_Hacking_Keyboard) style plate that will go along with this build. The plate is laser cut steel that will be painted blue to match soon.

Second: a [Zorbcaps](https://geekhack.org/index.php?action=profile;u=48371) Chilly Entling. My collection of artisan caps is slowly growing. I'm no BBv2 fiend, but I'm pleased with what I've acquired thus far. The Chilly Entling has a subtle offwhite color with pale blue accents. The inspiration being [Ents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ent) from LOTR.

Finally: a **new in box** IBM keyboard from the mid 1980s. This is a model 6112884, which is related to the infamous [IBM 4704](http://kishy.ca/?p=648) boards.

Unlike most IBM boards using [buckling spring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckling_spring) switches, this variant uses Alps switches. Specifically it's equipped with [Alps SKCC](https://deskthority.net/wiki/Alps_SKCC_Green)(also called Alps T Mount) switches, which predate the [SKCM](https://deskthority.net/wiki/Alps_SKCL/SKCM_series) switches I'm so fond of. The SKCCs in this board are heavy green linears with a sublte soft bottom out.

The board has AT for connectivity, and what appears to be [dyesub](https://deskthority.net/wiki/Keycap_printing#Dye_sublimation) PBT keycaps. Notable about this board is its Japanese layout and legends. Unlike most alps boards, the keycaps here are high-profile sphericals. They have much more in common with [Signature Plastics SA](http://keycapsdirect.com/key-caps.php) profile than the typical OEM style profile seen on most Alps boards at that time.

It's amazing to find a board from that era in this condition, much less for the price I paid for it. I picked this up for $25+ shipping from [Mendelsons](http://meci.com/nib-ibm-japanese-lettering-typing-computer-102-keyboard-letter-type-6112884.html), a warehouse liquidator in Ohio.

As is sits right now, the board is not compatible with modern-day computers, but I'm sure I'll make a future project of either converting it by hand-wiring a matrix, or by using one of [Hasu's converters](https://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=54706.0).
