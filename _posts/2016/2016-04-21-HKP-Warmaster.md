[Hot Keys Project](https://www.facebook.com/hotkeysproject/) had a sale last month for Easter themed keycaps. I picked up this Warmaster in anticipation for my Satan GH60 build.

I'm not 100% certain I'll end up using this on that board full time. I think I'm happier with how my Entling looks. Either way, the HKP keycap is pretty rad. I'll find a home somewhere for it.
