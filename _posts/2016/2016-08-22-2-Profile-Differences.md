I'm back to trying to use [SA profile](http://keycapsdirect.com/key-caps.php) keycaps on ErgoDox. I found that in the first couple days, the SA key's high profile was making it difficult to type, and thus quite difficult to become accustomed to the ErgoDox layout. For a few days last week I switched to [DSA profile](http://keycapsdirect.com/key-caps.php) keycaps. I've now gone back to SA, and having a week of ErgoDox under my belt I find SA to work quite well.

I couldn't help but note the difference in height between DSA (right) and SA (left). SA is high, thick, ABS, but I didn't realize how big the height difference was until now.
