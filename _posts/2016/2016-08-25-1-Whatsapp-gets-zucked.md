> WhatsApp has updated its terms of service and privacy policy to reflect that it will begin sharing select data with Facebook, including the phone number a user verifies during the registration process and the last time a user accessed the service. Facebook, which acquired WhatsApp in 2014, will use the information to provide better friend suggestions and targeted ads and offers to users of its own service.

WhatsApp insists that no messages or content will be shared with Facebook. That said, to reveal the data they _are_ revealing to Facebook would require sending metadata to Facebook. As we know from Snowden, metadata is still incredibly powerful. This is just the beginning. Beleive you me.

Glad I never started using Whatsapp, even after they went encrypted by default.
