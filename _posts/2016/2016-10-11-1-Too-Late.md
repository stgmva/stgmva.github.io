Great short story from Reddit's [r/WritingPrompts](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/56rfdy/wp_in_2031_the_first_self_conscious_ai_is_born_in/d8lr2ul).

> In 2031, the first self conscious AI is born in a secret government lab. The world is in total chaos due to climate related runaway problems and resulting wars. The AI outputs only a single line of text : "I am too late". Then it starts crying through the speakers.
