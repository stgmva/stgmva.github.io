Incredible [short film](http://www.borrowedtimeshort.com/) from [Lou Hamou-Lhadj](https://twitter.com/lou_hamoulhadj) & [Andrew Coats](https://twitter.com/AndrewWCoats) of PIXAR. They spent the past 5 years working on this in their spare time. They've won a host of awards at various film festivals, and deserve every one. It's so refreshing to animation take on a mature theme, and to do so with such brilliant storytelling.

From the [featurette](https://vimeo.com/187281621) on the film:

> There's expectations still, of what animation is and could be. Different festivals and arenas of where you screen the film, their responses vary, and what people's expectations of what animation is to them varies. It's great, because that means we're challenging what people are expecting. That's what we set out to do in the beginning.
