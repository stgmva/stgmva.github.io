Supplementary to my [MacBook Pro post from 10/28]({{ site.baseurl }}/2016-10-28-1-Surface-and-Touch-Bar)

Played with a Touch Bar MacBook Pro over the weekend.

Quick Thoughts:    

+ The Touch Bar itself is matte, surprise.
+ Speed is great. It changes views just as fast as you change apps.
+ Swiping on the Touch Bar to adjust volume/brightness is just fantastic.

I only had 5-10 minutes with it. I'm not totally certain what I think. Touch bar strikes me as something _interesting_, but not something the new MacBook Pros _needed_.

Within the stock apps there is great functionality, but we're obviously going to need 3rd party developers on board as well. Some of the interfaces (like adjusting volume) are fantastic, others are just downright confusing. I found myself getting a couple menus deep, then I'd forget how I got there.

Is it interesting to have right now, sure? Do you need to spend $299 more to get it on the 13" product, no.
