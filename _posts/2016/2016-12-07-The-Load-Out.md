Tomorrow I'm taking a 5 hour drive to one of my work's other offices. I'll be there for 3 days upgrading a bunch of the Macs. Of course I'll still have all my standard Help Desk duties while I'm there too.

One can never be too prepared so I'm bringing everything I can think of. I'll have my MacBook Pro, my Surface, a freshly imaged MacBook Pro (just in case one of the upgrades goes awry), and a smattering of hard drives, docks, and flash drives for data migration.
