> [Peeqo](http://peeqo.com/) is a personal desktop robotic assistant who expresses himself through GIFs. Think of him as the love child of Amazon Echo and a Disney character. He has a conversational UI, so he responds to voice commands but answers only through GIFs.

This is an amazing DIY project from [abhi3188](https://www.reddit.com/user/abhi3188) on Reddit. I'm amazed at the build quality shown for a one off.

He has a complete build log on [Imgur](https://imgur.com/a/ue4Ax).
