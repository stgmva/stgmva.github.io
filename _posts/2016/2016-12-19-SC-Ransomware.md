> A bill pre-filed this month by state Rep. Bill Chumley would require sellers to install digital blocking capabilities on computers and other devices that access the internet to prevent the viewing of obscene content.    
<br><br>
The proposal also would prohibit access to any online hub that facilities prostitution and would require manufacturers or sellers to block any websites that facilitate trafficking.
<br><br>
Both sellers and buyers could get around the limitation, for a fee. The bill would fine manufacturers that sell a device without the blocking system, but they could opt out by paying $20 per device sold. Buyers could also verify their age and pay $20 to remove the filter.

Government sanctioned and mandated ransomware, great. I can understand where Chumley is coming from, but I think that citizens of this country are intelligent enough to make their own decisions about which content they do and don't want to view on their own computers.

Bills like this one seek only to limit our technological freedom. What's funny of course is that sophisticated users will find ways around this (or turn to [FLOSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software)), whereas the common user will be stuck under Chumley's thumb.
