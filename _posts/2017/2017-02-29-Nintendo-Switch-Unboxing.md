I haven't owned a Nintendo Console since the SNES. My first reaction when I saw the first [Switch promo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5uik5fgIaI) was: I want one.

 The concept and execution here looks great. I haven't been following the Switch too closely since the reveal, but I'll be keeping my eye on it.

My main concern is the accessories. Seems like a lot is required outside of what comes in the main box.
