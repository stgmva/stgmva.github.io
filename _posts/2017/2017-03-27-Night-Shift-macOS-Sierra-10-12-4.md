[Night Shift](http://www.imore.com/night-shift-ios-93-explained) is a lot like the third party software [F.lux](https://justgetflux.com/). I've been a big fan of F.lux for a while now. Since starting to use it (and Night Shift on iOS) I've noticed a significant reduction in eye strain at night.

I'm glad to see Apple bring this feature to macOS, as it's been present on iOS for some time now. I'm sure I'll switch over to using it.
