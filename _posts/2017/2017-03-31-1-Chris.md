This is really clever. If you're like me and don't have a brand spankin' new 2017 car with Android Auto or Carplay, to use your phone for nav you're reliant on a phone mount on the dash. Phone mounts are just so clunky. You've gotta hook up cables, put it in the mount, yuck.

Chris talks to a phone over bluetooth, and talks to the car over bluetooth or FM, so every car is supported.

Check it out on [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/germanautolabs/chris-your-digital-co-driver-with-artificial-intel?ref=popular). Prices start at $190.
