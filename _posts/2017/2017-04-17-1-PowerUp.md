Made by [Homey](https://www.indiegogo.com/individuals/16124107), this charger is currently up on [IndieGoGo](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/powerup-the-macbook-charger-that-does-more--3#/). It's a full-sized USB-C charger with 3 integrated USB A ports for charge and sync. Clever.

Entry level price is $69 (same as [Apple's USB-C charger](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MNF72LL/A/61w-usb-c-power-adapter)), but it'll retail for $129.
