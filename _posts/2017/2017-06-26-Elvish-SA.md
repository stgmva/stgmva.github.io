I've been waiting for this set since December last year. The Elvish SA [group buy](https://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=86395.0) was ran by [Sennin32](http://www.ebay.com/usr/sennin32) of [Doyu Studio](https://shopkey.doyustudio.com/). Sennin32 isn't well known as a group buy leader among the Geekhack and r/MK crowd, but they are well known on eBay. If you've bought a Satan GH60, you probably bought it from Sennin32.

Elvish SA is a Chinese-manufactured clone of Signature Plastics' [SA profile](http://keycapsdirect.com/key-caps.php) keycaps. At only $70, these keycaps are significantly cheaper than Signature Plastics typical $100+ offerings.

This group by predates the wide availability of other SA clones like those from [MaxKey](https://www.old.keyclack.com/product/group-buy-maxkey-sa/). I've a set of MaxKeys on order from KeyClack, so I'll have a post about those when they arrive.

The set is made with single shot PBT plastic, with a mix of [dyesub](https://deskthority.net/wiki/Keycap_printing#Dye_sublimation) and [laser etched](https://deskthority.net/wiki/Keycap_printing#Engraving) legends. The set has dual legends in both English and Elvish. Row profile is 1-3-3-3-3. The dyesub work is just _okay_. Legends are not particularly sharp, especially on the Elvish legends. The laser etched legends, however are clear and sharp. I would've rather seen the entire set be laser etched. Texture on the keys is good, there's a slight texture present, but these are no where near as rough as other PBT sets like Signature Plastics DSA. Stems left a bit to be desired, they aren't very consistent - some keys were easy to put on switches, others took much more effort.

Overall this set is _okay_. If you're looking for SA profile the price point is quite nice, but the quality isn't nearly as good as Signature Plastics. It was worth buying, but I wouldn't buy a set from the same manufacturer again.
