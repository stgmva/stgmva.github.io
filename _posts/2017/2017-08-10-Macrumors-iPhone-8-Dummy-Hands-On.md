> We can't be 100 percent sure the dummy models we've seen are accurate representations of what we can expect when the iPhone 8 launches, but they match up with leaked factory specifications, part leaks, CAD drawings, and information culled from the HomePod firmware Apple released in late July.
<br><br>
For that reason, we believe the dummy model in the video offers up a clear look at what Apple's iPhone 8 looks like.

I’m happy to see one of these hands on videos compare the dummy model’s size to both iPhone 7 and 7 Plus. When I went from iPhone 6 Plus to iPhone 7, I was happy to have a much smaller phone, but it was bittersweet to lose the Plus’ massive screen. iPhone 8/Pro looks to be only marginally bigger than a standard iPhone 7, with a 5.8” display - the best of both worlds.
