Wow.    

It’s just...its just all screen. 

#### Update iPhone X Day 2

This phone is amazing. The screen _feels_ gigantic, yet the phone is physically more or less the same size as a standard 4.7” iPhone. iPhone X is everything I wanted my old iPhone 6 Plus to be.

FaceID is fantastic - easily better than TouchID. It’s effortless ambient authentication.
