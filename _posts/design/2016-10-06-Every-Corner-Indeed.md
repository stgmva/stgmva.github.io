> When the US Hispanic Chamber of Commerce encouraged taco trucks to become voter registration centers, cities across the country followed suit. A few weeks ago, the USHCC set a plan into motion to increase Latino turnout following Latinos for Trump founder Marco Gutierrez’s disparaging comments about his own community. He claimed that Latino culture is so imposing that if it goes unchecked, we’ll soon have “taco trucks on every corner.”

> The Arizona Democratic Party has managed to get 150 taco trucks to register voters across the state. Mi Familia Vota’s hopes to set up taco trucks in the battleground state of Nevada. With the USHCC also encouraging taco trucks to park their vehicles outside of polling stations on Election Day, it’s very likely that we’re closer to having taco trucks on every corner.

I love this response. Anything to get more voters registered is a good thing.
