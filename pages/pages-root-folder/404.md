Once upon a midnight dreary<br>
while I browsed weak and weary.    
<br>    
Over a many quaint and curious <br>    
blogs with posts galore.     
<br>     
While I clicked my fav'rite bookmark, <br>    
suddenly there came a warning,    <br>
And my heart was filled with mourning,    <br>
Mourning for my dear amour.     <br>
<br>    
'Tis not possible, I pleaded,    <br>
But my browser, so conceited, -    <br>
Remained blank, I then repeated,    <br>
Just a blank, and nothing more,    <br>
<br>
  <h4>Quoth The Server</h4>
